<h1>My Experience in GLM</h1>

<p>I wish I can tell you who I was but I didn't even know me myself. And how a once confused, hopeless, restless, sick, broke...person like me became an epitome of grace is a wonder and I have God and my FATHER, APOSTLE JOSEPH IBRAHIM to thank for that.</p>
<hr>
<p>The good thing about this is that the future holds more. I'll forever be grateful to God for the blesssing of APOSTLE to me, and this generation. come, and experience the transformative power of God in GLM. </p>
